    <h4>Hunting:</h4>
        
    <p>There are many types of guns out there. Today we are going to go over shotguns and rifles. When hunting squirrels with a shotgun, always keep in mind that they don't shoot as far and as fast as rifles. I (personally) like to use a 20-gauge shotgun. It doesn't have that much kick and it is a great little gun. </p>
<br><br>

<p>On to rifles. For hunting squirrels I (again, personally) like to use a .17. (.17 caliber.) Why? No reason, really. I just happen to like .17s and the way they shoot. Another common squirrel gun is the .22. It is slightly bigger than the .17 (by 500ths of an inch) and is commonly used in hunting small game. (Rabbits, ground squirrels, birds, rats etc.)</p>
<p>Another thing I want to go over is the breakdown of a cartridge. First of all, they&#39;re not called bullets. Bullets are tiny black dots like this:

A "cartridge" is the whole thing. The "bullet" is the part that actually shoots.

<br><h4>Trapping:</h4>


<p>I have used many types of traps to trap squirrels. From simple to modern to just wierd. Here we are going to go over 3 of them.

</p>

<li>Snare Trap</li>
<li>Pole Trap</li>
<li>Live Trap</li>
</p>

<h4>The Snare Trap</h4>

<p id="snare-trap">You will need:

<li>A springy tree</li>
<li>Rope (not too big)</li>
<li>One v-like stick</li>
<li>Two small sticks 1 1/2 inches long</li>
</p>
<br><br><br>


<li>Tie a short piece of rope to the top of the tree.</li>
<li>Tie a small stick to the other end of the rope.</li>
<li>Pound a v-stick into the ground until it is almost covered but leave a small hole.</li>
<li>Stick the stick on the end of the rope through the hole.</li>
<li>Use another small stick to support it so it cannot pull back until the stick supporting it goes away.</li>
